Incoming graduate student at UC San Diego specializing in formal methods research and software engineering.

I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from UMass Boston, where I graduated summa cum laude. In the past, I have provided supplemental instruction for students at the undergraduate level, covering fundamental topics in automata theory, computibility, and complexity theory.

I was also the past recipient of the Oracle Fellowship at UMass Boston, which I used to improve the accuracy of a [correctness verifier](https://gitlab.com/umb-svl/faial) developed by the [Software Verification Lab](https://umb-svl.gitlab.io/).

In my spare time, I am a rock climber, yogi, and [indie film producer](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm11805885/).
